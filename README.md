# job-finder-api
A job search API based on FastAPI that scrapes listings from sites such as LinkedIn and Indeed. It sifts through jobs for users according to their criteria with AI-driven relevance scoring and returns suitable recommendations.

# Job Search API Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Job Search API, detailing its available endpoints, data models, and core functionality.

## Overview

The Job Search API enables users to search for job opportunities across multiple platforms, including LinkedIn, Indeed, and Google Jobs. It processes search results based on user-defined criteria and returns relevant job listings in a standardized format.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /find-jobs`

Searches for jobs across multiple platforms based on the provided search criteria.

#### Request Parameters

| Parameter       | Type            | Description                          | Default | Constraints            |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|---------|------------------------|
| `request`       | JobSearchRequest | Search criteria object               | -       | Required               |
| `limit`         | integer         | Maximum number of results to return | 3       | Min: 1, Max: 5         |

## Implementation Details

### Job Sources

The API fetches job listings from the following primary sources:

- **LinkedIn**: Uses the JSearch API with a fallback to web scraping if the API is unavailable or returns no results.
- **Indeed**: Utilizes the JSearch API.
- **Google Jobs**: Leverages the Jobs API v14.

### Job Processing Pipeline

1. **Search**: Aggregates job listings from all supported platforms.
2. **Description Enrichment**: Fetches detailed job descriptions for enhanced relevancy scoring.
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Scores jobs based on their match to the search criteria.
4. **Skills Matching**: Matches user-provided skills against job descriptions.
5. **Sorting**: Prioritizes results based on relevance score.
6. **Formatting**: Prepares the final output in a standardized format for consistency.

### Rate Limiting

To maintain compliance with third-party API rate limits, the API implements the following strategies:
- **Exponential Backoff**: Retries failed requests with increasing intervals.
- **429 Error Handling**: Manages "Too Many Requests" responses gracefully.
- **Random Jitter**: Adds random delays to avoid request clustering.

### Error Handling

- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes for all scenarios.
- Logs detailed error information for debugging and monitoring.
- Implements fallback mechanisms to ensure continuity when primary data sources fail.

## Configuration

The API requires the following environment variables:

- `JSEARCH_API_KEY`: API key for JSearch (LinkedIn and Indeed).
- `JOBS_API_KEY`: API key for Jobs API (Google Jobs).
- `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`: API key for scoring job relevance.
- I got these API keys from rapidapi.

## Running the API

To run the API locally, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The API will be accessible at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available once the server is running:

- **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **ReDoc**: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

## How the Job Matching System Works

Our job search aggregation and matching system uses a multi-layered approach to identify the most relevant job opportunities across multiple platforms. Below is an overview of how it works:

### 1. Data Collection from Multiple Sources
The system queries multiple job platforms simultaneously to gather a diverse set of opportunities:

- **LinkedIn**: Utilizes LinkedIn's job postings via the JSearch API, with a fallback to direct web scraping if the API does not return results.
- **Indeed**: Retrieves job listings from Indeed using the JSearch API.
- **Google Jobs**: Collects job postings from Google's job aggregation service via the Jobs API v14.

For each platform, we implement both API-based collection and fallback scraping mechanisms to ensure reliability and comprehensive coverage.

### 2. Intelligent Job Description Processing
For high-potential job opportunities, the system:

- Fetches complete job descriptions where available.
- Extracts key details, such as salary ranges, experience requirements, and job type (remote/onsite).
- Standardizes data formats across different platforms.
- Applies rate limiting to comply with API usage policies and prevent IP blocking.

### 3. Advanced Relevance Scoring
At the core of the system is a relevance scoring engine that:

- Leverages the Hugging Face API with the Flan-T5 model to evaluate job-to-user match quality.
- Implements a sophisticated prompt-based scoring system that considers:
  - **Position title relevance**.
  - **Location matching**.
  - **Salary range compatibility**.
  - **Experience level alignment**.
  - **Job type preference** (remote vs. onsite).
  - **Skills matching** between user profiles and job requirements.

### 4. Skills-Based Matching
The system performs detailed skills analysis by:

- Extracting skills from job descriptions using natural language processing (NLP).
- Matching these skills against user-provided profiles.
- Applying a weighted scoring boost based on the percentage of matched skills.
- Assigning additional weight to skills mentioned in the job title.

### 5. Prefiltering and Optimization
To optimize processing time and maintain quality, the system:

- Prefilters jobs based on key parameters such as position title and location.
- Conducts comprehensive analysis for a limited number of high-potential jobs.
- Simplifies scoring for the remaining jobs, focusing primarily on skills matching.
- Caches results to improve performance for similar searches.

### 6. Results Ranking and Presentation
Finally, the system:

- Sorts jobs by relevance score in descending order.
- Formats the results with standardized fields for clean presentation.
- Returns a curated set of the most relevant opportunities to the user.
